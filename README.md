# Music Recommendation System

## Description

This project implements a simple music recommendation system using Python. It allows users to listen to songs, tracks their play counts, and recommends new songs based on their listening preferences. The system utilizes the Faker library to generate random song data, providing a realistic simulation of user interactions with a music catalog.

## Features

- **User Interaction**: Users can listen to songs, and their play counts are tracked.
- **Top Genres Calculation**: The system calculates the top genres based on the songs a user has listened to.
- **Song Recommendations**: Users receive song recommendations based on their top genres, ensuring a personalized experience.
- **Random Song Generation**: Utilizes the Faker library to generate random song titles, artists, and genres for a diverse catalog.
